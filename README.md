# Ten Simple Rules for Using Cloud Computing (in Life Sciences?)
A short article for 10 simple rules in Cloud Computing and Bioinformatics / Life Sciences


## Introduction


## Rule 1:

Understand what Cloud Computing actually is (and stands for)

## Rule 2:

Search for existing advice (there is always someone who tried something similar already)

## Rule 3:

Decide on the “Pet” or “Cattle” approach

## Rule 4:

Data Management planning - security and privacy are primary concerns. Putting your whole data center in the cloud almost never works out. Sensitive data -> HIPAA-compliant.

## Rule 5:

Establish a reproducible computational workflow. Technical requirements are always known, but expect serious re-tweaking to get a cloud-based solution to work in the optimal way.

## Rule 6:

Integrating different components is always a puzzle; solve it before it happens

## Rule 7:

Execution on Commercial or public e-infrastructure? Public is good in order to evaluate the ultimate feasibility of the solution. Commercial shines for short-/mid-term production-level deployment (especially of the “cattle” paradigm).

## Rule 8:

First attempt will always have issues; treat it as a training experience

## Rule 9:

Documentation is King. Establish the success metrics and test against them at each iteration.

## Rule 10:

Maintain and publish the log book (i.e. adhere to the Open Science rules)
